## Introduction
After macroeconomic and industry analysis, we plan to use NTD 50,000,000 to create an investment portfolio in OTC-listed Internet companies in Taiwan. For our project, we have decided to build the portfolio using 4 ETFs. Finally, we will develop a backtesting model to confirm the portfolio's performance.

Apply variance analysis and Markowitz Efficient Frontier Theory to find the optimal investment portfolio. Conduct backtesting for the years 2019-2021 and during periods of maximum market volatility, achieving a 3% return with a 10% risk.
